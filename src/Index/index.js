    title: "Introduction to React Hooks",
    content: `Learn about React hooks and how they make state management and side effects easier in React. Hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext have transformed how developers write components, eliminating the need for class-based components in most cases. We’ll cover useState for managing component state, useEffect for handling side effects, and useContext for accessing global data. Understanding hooks allows for a cleaner, functional approach to React components, simplifying the codebase and improving readability.`,
    headers: [
      {
        title: "1 - What are React Hooks?",
        content: `React hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. Before hooks, these features were only available in class components. Hooks provide a more concise, functional way to write React components and manage state.`
      },
      {
        title: "2 - The useState Hook",
        content: `The useState hook is used to declare state variables in a functional component. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update it. This simplifies state management, eliminating the need for class-based component state handling.`
      },
      {
        title: "3 - The useEffect Hook",
        content: `The useEffect hook handles side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM in React components. It runs after the component renders, making it perfect for tasks that need to interact with external systems or APIs.`
      },
      {
        title: "4 - The useContext Hook",
        content: `useContext allows you to access and share state across components without passing props through every level of your component tree. It helps manage global state and makes it easier to avoid "prop drilling" in large applications.`
      },
      {
        title: "5 - Benefits of Using Hooks in React",
        content: `Using hooks simplifies the codebase by replacing complex class components with cleaner, more maintainable functional components. It also makes it easier to manage state, handle side effects, and share data between components. Hooks are a key feature that makes React more powerful and intuitive.`
      },
      {
        title: "6 - Custom Hooks",
        content: `Custom hooks are user-defined hooks that allow you to extract and reuse logic between components. This promotes code reuse and separation of concerns, making your code more modular and maintainable.`

    content: `Get to know Node.js and how it enables JavaScript to run on the server side. Node.js opens up a world of possibilities for JavaScript developers beyond the browser. In this post, we explore Node's fundamentals, its non-blocking I/O model, and how it differs from traditional server-side frameworks. We'll also discuss Node's package manager (NPM) and popular libraries like Express.js for building REST APIs. Node has become a backbone for many backend systems and is particularly favored for applications that require scalability and fast, asynchronous processing.`,

        title: "1 - What is Node.js?",
        content: `Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that enables JavaScript to be run on the server-side. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine, which is also used by Google Chrome, allowing JavaScript to perform highly efficient and scalable operations.`
      },
      {
        title: "2 - The Non-Blocking I/O Model",
        content: `Node.js operates on a non-blocking, event-driven architecture. This means that instead of waiting for one operation to finish before starting another, Node.js can handle multiple operations concurrently, improving performance for tasks like I/O operations.`
      },
      {
        title: "3 - Node.js vs Traditional Server-Side Frameworks",
        content: `Unlike traditional server-side frameworks that use multi-threading, Node.js uses a single thread to handle multiple requests asynchronously. This makes it particularly efficient for I/O-bound tasks, as it avoids the overhead of thread management.`
